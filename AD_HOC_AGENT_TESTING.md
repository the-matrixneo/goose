## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Agent Manager implementation in goosed (goose-server). The Agent Manager represents a fundamental architectural shift from a single shared agent to a per-session agent model, addressing critical concurrency issues and enabling true multi-user support.

## Current Implementation Status - VERIFIED ✅

### Completed Work
- **AgentManager Core**: Implemented in `crates/goose/src/agents/manager.rs`
  - Session-to-agent mapping ✅ VERIFIED
  - Agent lifecycle management ✅ VERIFIED
  - Idle cleanup functionality ✅ VERIFIED
  - Metrics tracking ✅ VERIFIED

- **goose-server Integration**: Routes updated to use AgentManager
  - `state.rs`: Migrated from shared agent to AgentManager ✅ VERIFIED
  - `reply.rs`: Session-specific agent retrieval ✅ VERIFIED
  - `extension.rs`, `agent.rs`, `context.rs`: Updated for per-session agents ✅ VERIFIED
  - Monitoring endpoints added: `/agent/stats`, `/agent/cleanup` ✅ VERIFIED

- **Unit Tests**: Basic test coverage exists
  - Agent per session isolation ✅ VERIFIED
  - Cleanup functionality ✅ VERIFIED
  - Metrics tracking ✅ VERIFIED
  - Concurrent access handling ✅ VERIFIED

### Testing Results (2025-09-05)
Successfully verified AgentManager functionality with live testing:
- Created 2 unique agents for different sessions
- Confirmed session reuse (cache hit when using same session_id)
- Metrics accurately tracked: `agents_created: 2, cache_hits: 1, cache_misses: 2`
- Cleanup endpoint functional
- Backward compatibility confirmed (auto-generates session_id)

### Architecture Changes

#### Before (Problematic)
```rust
pub struct AppState {
    agent: Arc<RwLock<AgentRef>>,  // SINGLE SHARED AGENT
}

After (Current Implementation)


pub struct AppState {
    agent_manager: Arc<AgentManager>,  // Per-session agent management
}

Testing Environment Setup

1. Local goosed Instance Configuration

Basic Setup


# Build the latest goosed with AgentManager
cd /Users/tlongwell/Development/goose
cargo build -p goose-server --bin goosed

# Start goosed with explicit configuration (MUST use screen for servers)
screen -dmS goosed_test bash -c "
  RUST_LOG=info \
  GOOSE_PORT=8081 \
  GOOSE_API_KEY=\$(cat ~/keys/oncall_buddy_goose_etc_databricks.txt) \
  GOOSE_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=databricks \
  GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY=test123 \
  GOOSE_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest \
  ./target/debug/goosed agent
"

# Verify it's running
lsof -i :8081

# Stop the session
screen -r goosed_test -X stuff $'\003' && screen -X -S goosed_test quit

Important Notes


MUST use screen for servers - Background processes don't work properly without it

Secret key environment variable: GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY (note the double underscore!)

Secret key header: X-Secret-Key (case-sensitive)

No /api prefix - Routes are directly under root (e.g., /reply, /agent/stats)

Default secret key: If not set, defaults to "test"


2. Provider Configuration

Databricks Provider


API Key Location: ~/keys/oncall_buddy_goose_etc_databricks.txt

Environment Variable: GOOSE_API_KEY

Provider Name: databricks

Security: Never cat or expose the key in logs/context


Testing Methodology

Phase 1: Unit Testing (Completed)

Located in crates/goose/tests/agent_manager_test.rs:




Session Isolation



Verify each session gets unique agent

Confirm same session reuses same agent

Test agent pointer equality




Resource Management



Test idle agent cleanup

Verify memory reclamation

Test agent recreation after cleanup




Concurrency



Multiple threads accessing same session

Verify no race conditions

Test mutex contention handling




Metrics



Track agent creation/cleanup

Monitor cache hits/misses

Verify active agent counts




Phase 2: Integration Testing

Test 1: Multi-Session Isolation


# Create test script: test_multi_session.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Session 1: Create and use agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/reply \
  -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test_session_1",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from session 1"}]
  }' &

# Session 2: Concurrent request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/reply \
  -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test_session_2",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from session 2"}]
  }' &

wait

Test 2: Extension Isolation


# Test that extensions loaded in one session don't affect another
# Session 1: Load extension
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/extension/add \
  -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "ext_test_1",
    "extension": {"type": "builtin", "name": "memory"}
  }'

# Session 2: Verify extension not present
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/extension/list \
  -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "ext_test_2"}'

Test 3: Provider Configuration Per Session


# Test different provider configurations per session
# Session 1: Default provider
# Session 2: Different model/temperature

Phase 3: Performance Testing

Benchmark Metrics



Agent Creation Time



Target: < 10ms per agent

Measure: Time from request to agent ready




Memory Usage



Baseline: Memory with 0 agents

Per-agent overhead: Expected 5-20MB

Test with 10, 50, 100 concurrent sessions




Cleanup Performance



Idle timeout: 5 minutes default

Cleanup execution: < 100ms

No impact on active sessions

Testing Tools and Scripts

Monitoring Script


#!/bin/bash
# monitor_goosed.sh

while true; do
    echo "=== $(date) ==="
    
    # Memory usage
    ps aux | grep goosed | grep -v grep | awk '{print "Memory: " $6/1024 " MB"}'
    
    # Open connections
    lsof -i :8080 | wc -l | awk '{print "Connections: " $1-1}'
    
    # Active agents (would need API endpoint)
    # curl -s -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" http://localhost:8080/api/agent/stats
    
    sleep 5
done

Session Cleanup Verification


#!/bin/bash
# verify_cleanup.sh

# Create sessions
for i in {1..10}; do
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/reply \
      -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"session_id\": \"cleanup_test_$i\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"test\"}]}" &
done
wait

# Wait for idle timeout
sleep 310  # 5 minutes + buffer

# Trigger cleanup (would need API endpoint)
# curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/agent/cleanup \
#   -H "X-Secret-Key: test_secret"

# Verify agents were cleaned
# Check memory usage decreased

Known Issues and Limitations

Current Implementation


No API endpoints for agent stats - Need to add monitoring endpoints

Cleanup is time-based only - No memory pressure triggers

No agent pooling - Each session creates fresh agent

Limited provider caching - Providers recreated per agent


Testing Gaps


Production load patterns - Need real-world usage data

Extension compatibility - Not all extensions tested

Network failure scenarios - Limited fault injection

Resource exhaustion - Need better OOM testing


Recommendations

Immediate Actions


Add monitoring API endpoints for agent statistics

Implement memory-based cleanup triggers

Add agent pooling for frequently accessed sessions

Create comprehensive integration test suite


Future Enhancements


Agent Pooling: Pre-warm agents for faster startup

Smart Cleanup: ML-based prediction of session activity

Resource Quotas: Per-user/tenant resource limits

Connection Pooling: Share provider connections

Distributed Mode: Multi-instance coordination


Conclusion

The Agent Manager implementation represents a critical architectural improvement that addresses fundamental concurrency issues in Goose. The testing strategy outlined here provides comprehensive coverage of functionality, performance, and reliability aspects.


Key achievements:



Session isolation: Each session has its own agent

Scalability: Support for many concurrent users

Resource management: Automatic cleanup of idle resources

Maintainability: Cleaner architecture with clear boundaries


The phased testing approach ensures thorough validation while allowing for iterative improvements. With proper monitoring and the recommended enhancements, the Agent Manager will provide a solid foundation for Goose's multi-user capabilities.
