# Documentation Style Guide

## Brand Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: The product name "goose" should ALWAYS be written in lowercase "g" in all documentation, blog posts, and any content within this documentation directory.

- ✅ Correct: "goose", "using goose", "goose provides"
- ❌ Incorrect: "Goose", "using Goose", "Goose provides"

This is a brand guideline that must be strictly followed.

## Context

This rule applies to:
- All markdown files in `/docs/`
- All blog posts in `/blog/`
- README files
- Configuration files with user-facing text
- Any other documentation content

When editing or creating content in this documentation directory, always ensure "goose" uses a lowercase "g".
