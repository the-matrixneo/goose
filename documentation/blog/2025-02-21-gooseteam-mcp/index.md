During our [previous livestream](https://youtu.be/9tq-QUnE29U), Aaron Goldsmith, Infrastructure Operations Engineer at Cash App, showed a team of goose AI agents collaborating in real time to create a website. Our community loved it so much, Cliff Hall was inspired to iterate on that idea and create a gooseTeam MCP server.

## The Original Protocol

Aaron Goldsmith made an AI agent team consisting of multiple goose instances a reality with his lightweight [Agent Communication Protocol](https://gist.github.com/AaronGoldsmith/114c439ae67e4f4c47cc33e829c82fac). With it, each goose agent enters the chat, gets assigned a role (e.g. Project Coordinator, Researcher, Web Developer), and works on its part of a given task. The protocol specifies instructions guiding how the agents should talk and behave, allowing multiple goose agents to collaborate. It also specifies that communication between the agents should be done via a Python-based websocket server with text/markdown . 

## gooseTeam MCP Server

Introducing [gooseTeam](https://github.com/cliffhall/gooseTeam), created by Software Architect and community member, Cliff Hall. gooseTeam takes Aaron's protocol and iterates on it into an MCP server and collaboration protocol for goose Agents. With features like task management, message storage, and agent waiting, you can have an entire team of goose agents work together on a task or project for you.

A goose agent with the Project Coordinator role will assign roles to other agents, your connected agents will send messages that can retrieved at any time, and your team of agents will connect to the same MCP server to collaborate together.

## A New Way to goose

Working with a team of AI agents on a task is a game changer. Instead of getting confused as to how to improve your prompt engineering on your own or work across sessions manually, tools like Cliff's gooseTeam or Aaron's Agent Communication Protocol help us make sure AI agents like goose are doing the work for us as efficiently as possible. The possibilities feel endless!
