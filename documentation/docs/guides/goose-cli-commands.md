```

---

#### schedule
Automate recipes by running them on a [schedule](/docs/guides/recipes/session-recipes.md#schedule-recipe).

**Commands:**
- `add <OPTIONS>`: Create a new scheduled job. Copies the current version of the recipe to `~/.local/share/goose/scheduled_recipes`
- `list`: View all scheduled jobs
- `remove`: Delete a scheduled job
- `sessions`: List sessions created by a scheduled recipe
- `run-now`: Run a scheduled recipe immediately

**Temporal Commands (requires Temporal CLI):**
- `services-status`: Check if any Temporal services are running
- `services-stop`: Stop any running Temporal services

**Options:**
- `--id <NAME>`: A unique ID for the scheduled job (e.g. `daily-report`)
- `--cron "* * * * * *"`: Specifies when a job should run using a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression)
- `--recipe-source <PATH>`: Path to the recipe YAML file
- `--limit <NUMBER>`: Max number of sessions to display when using the `sessions` command

**Usage:**
```bash
goose schedule <COMMAND>

# Add a new scheduled recipe which runs every day at 9 AM
goose schedule add --id daily-report --cron "0 0 9 * * *" --recipe-source ./recipes/daily-report.yaml

# List all scheduled jobs
goose schedule list

# List the 10 most recent Goose sessions created by a scheduled job
goose schedule sessions --id daily-report --limit 10

# Run a recipe immediately
goose schedule run-now --id daily-report

# Remove a scheduled job
goose schedule remove --id daily-report
```

---

#### mcp
Run an enabled MCP server specified by `<name>` (e.g. `'Google Drive'`).

**Usage:**
```bash
goose mcp <name>
```

---

#### acp
Run Goose as an Agent Client Protocol (ACP) agent server over stdio. This enables Goose to work with ACP-compatible clients like Zed.

ACP is an emerging protocol specification that standardizes communication between AI agents and client applications, making it easier for clients to integrate with various AI agents.

**Usage:**
```bash
goose acp
```

:::info
This command is automatically invoked by ACP-compatible clients and is not typically run directly by users. The client manages the lifecycle of the `goose acp` process. See [Using Goose in ACP Clients](/docs/guides/acp-clients) for details.
:::

---

### Project Management

#### project
Start working on your last project or create a new one. For detailed usage examples and workflows, see [Managing Projects Guide](/docs/guides/managing-projects).

**Alias**: `p`

**Usage:**
```bash
goose project
```

---

#### projects
Choose one of your projects to start working on.

**Alias**: `ps`

**Usage:**
```bash
goose projects
```

---

### Interface

#### web
Start a new session in Goose Web, a lightweight web-based interface launched via the CLI that mirrors the desktop app's chat experience.

Goose Web is particularly useful when:
- You want to access Goose with a graphical interface without installing the desktop app
- You need to use Goose from different devices, including mobile
- You're working in an environment where installing desktop apps isn't practical

:::warning
Don't expose the web interface to the internet without proper security measures.
:::

**Options:**
- **`-p, --port <PORT>`**: Port number to run the web server on. Default is `3000`
- **`--host <HOST>`**: Host to bind the web server to. Default is `127.0.0.1`
- **`--open`**: Automatically open the browser when the server starts

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and open the browser
goose web --open

# Start web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` 
goose web --port 8080

# Start web interface accessible from local network at `http://192.168.1.7:8080`
goose web --host 192.168.1.7 --port 8080
```

:::info
Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.
:::

**Limitations:**

While the web interface provides most core features, be aware of these limitations:
- Some file system operations may require additional confirmation
- Extension management must be done through the CLI
- Certain tool interactions might need extra setup
- Configuration changes require a server restart

## Interactive Session Features

### Slash Commands

Once you're in an interactive session (via `goose session` or `goose run --interactive`), you can use these slash commands. All commands support tab completion. Press `/ + <Tab>` to cycle through available commands.

**Available Commands:**
- **`/?` or `/help`** - Display the help menu
- **`/builtin <names>`** - Add builtin extensions by name (comma-separated)
- **`/clear`** - Clear the current chat history
- **`/endplan`** - Exit plan mode and return to 'normal' goose mode
- **`/exit` or `/quit`** - Exit the session
- **`/extension <command>`** - Add a stdio extension (format: ENV1=val1 command args...)
- **`/mode <name>`** - Set the goose mode to use ('auto', 'approve', 'chat', 'smart_approve')
- **`/plan <message_text>`** - Enter 'plan' mode with optional message. Create a plan based on the current messages and ask user if they want to act on it
- **`/prompt <n> [--info] [key=value...]`** - Get prompt info or execute a prompt
- **`/prompts [--extension <name>]`** - List all available prompts, optionally filtered by extension
- **`/recipe [filepath]`** - Generate a recipe from the current conversation and save it to the specified filepath (must end with .yaml). If no filepath is provided, it will be saved to ./recipe.yaml
- **`/summarize`** - Summarize the current conversation to reduce context length while preserving key information
- **`/t`** - Toggle between `light`, `dark`, and `ansi` themes. [More info](#themes).
- **`/t <name>`** - Set theme directly (light, dark, ansi)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create a plan for triaging test failures
/plan let's create a plan for triaging test failures

# List all prompts from the developer extension
/prompts --extension developer

# Switch to chat mode
/mode chat

# Add a builtin extension during the session
/builtin developer

# Clear the current conversation history
/clear
```

---

### Themes

The `/t` command controls the syntax highlighting theme for markdown content in Goose CLI responses. This affects the styles used for headers, code blocks, bold/italic text, and other markdown elements in the response output.

**Commands:**
- `/t` - Cycles through themes: `light` → `dark` → `ansi` → `light`
- `/t light` - Sets `light` theme (subtle light colors)
- `/t dark` - Sets `dark` theme (subtle darker colors)
- `/t ansi` - Sets `ansi` theme (most visually distinct option with brighter colors)

**Configuration:**
- The default theme is `dark`
- The theme setting is saved to the [configuration file](/docs/guides/config-file) as `GOOSE_CLI_THEME` and persists between sessions
- The saved configuration can be overridden for the session using the `GOOSE_CLI_THEME` [environment variable](/docs/guides/environment-variables#session-management)

:::info
Syntax highlighting styles only affect the font, not the overall terminal interface. The `light` and `dark` themes have subtle differences in font color and weight.

The Goose CLI theme is independent from the Goose Desktop theme.
:::

**Examples:**
```bash
# Set ANSI theme for the session via environment variable
export GOOSE_CLI_THEME=ansi
goose session --name use-custom-theme

# Toggle theme during a session
/t

# Set the light theme during a session
/t light
```

## Navigation and Controls

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Session Control:**
- **`Ctrl+C`** - Interrupt the current request
- **`Ctrl+J`** - Add a newline

**Navigation:**
- **`Cmd+Up/Down arrows`** - Navigate through command history
- **`Ctrl+R`** - Interactive command history search (reverse search). [More info](#command-history-search).

---

### Command History Search

The `Ctrl+R` shortcut provides interactive search through your stored CLI [command history](/docs/guides/logs#command-history). This feature makes it easy to find and reuse recent commands without retyping them. When you type a search term, Goose searches backwards through your history for matches.

**How it works:**
1. Press `Ctrl+R` in your Goose CLI session
2. Type a search term
3. Navigate through the results using:
   - `Ctrl+R` to cycle backwards through earlier matches
   - `Ctrl+S` to cycle forward through newer matches
4. Press `Return` (or `Enter`) to run the found command, or `Esc` to cancel

For example, instead of retyping this long command:

```
analyze the performance issues in the sales database queries and suggest optimizations
```

Use the `"sales database"` or `"optimization"` search term to find and rerun it.

**Search tips:**
- **Distinctive terms work best**: Choose unique words or phrases to help filter the results
- **Partial matches and multiple words are supported**: You can search for phrases like `"gith"` and `"run the unit test"`
