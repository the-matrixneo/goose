Goose uses a unified storage system for conversations and interactions. All conversations and interactions (both CLI and Desktop) are stored **locally** in the following locations:

| **Type**            | **Unix-like (macOS, Linux)**              | **Windows**                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Command History** | `~/.config/goose/history.txt`          | `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\history.txt`    |
| **Session Records** | `~/.local/share/goose/sessions/`       | `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\sessions\`      |
| **System Logs**     | `~/.local/state/goose/logs/`           | `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\logs\`          |

:::info Privacy
Goose is a local application and all log files are stored locally. These logs are never sent to external servers or third parties, ensuring that all data remains private and under your control.

## Command History

Goose stores command history persistently across chat sessions, allowing Goose to recall previous commands.

Command history logs are stored in:

* Unix-like: ` ~/.config/goose/history.txt`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\history.txt`

## Session Records

Goose maintains session records in `~/.local/share/goose/sessions/` that track the conversation history and interactions for each session. These files use the `.jsonl` format (JSON Lines), where each line is a valid JSON object representing a message or interaction.

Session files are named with the pattern `[session-id].jsonl` where the session ID matches the identifier used in the corresponding log files. For example, `ccK9OTmS.jsonl` corresponds to log files like `20250211_133920-ccK9OTmS.log`.

Each session file contains a chronological record of:
- User messages and commands  (commands are also stored persistently in `history.txt`)
- Assistant (Goose) responses
- Tool requests and their results
- Timestamps for all interactions
- Role information (user/assistant)
- Message content and formatting
- Tool call details including:
  - Tool IDs
  - Arguments passed
  - Results returned
  - Success/failure status

Each line in a session file is a JSON object with the following key fields:
- `role`: Identifies the source ("user" or "assistant")
- `created`: Timestamp of the interaction
- `content`: Array of interaction elements, which may include:
  - Text messages
  - Tool requests
  - Tool responses
  - Error messages

## System Logs

### Main System Log

The main system log locations:
* Unix-like: `~/.local/state/goose/logs/goose.log`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\logs\goose.log`

This log contains general application-level logging including:
* Session file locations
* Token usage statistics as well as token counts (input, output, total)
* LLM information (model names, versions)


### Desktop Application Log

The desktop application maintains its own logs:
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Goose/logs/main.log`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\logs\main.log`

The Desktop application follows platform conventions for its own operational logs and state data, but uses the standard Goose [session records](#session-records) for actual conversations and interactions. This means your conversation history is consistent regardless of which interface you use to interact with Goose.

### CLI Logs 

CLI logs are stored in:
* Unix-like: `~/.local/state/goose/logs/cli/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\logs\cli\`

CLI session logs contain:
* Tool invocations and responses
* Command execution details
* Session identifiers
* Timestamps

Extension logs contain:
* Tool initialization
* Tool capabilities and schemas
* Extension-specific operations
* Command execution results
* Error messages and debugging information
* Extension configuration states
* Extension-specific protocol information

### Server Logs

Server logs are stored in:
* Unix-like: `~/.local/state/goose/logs/server/`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\goose\data\logs\server\`

The Server logs contain information about the Goose daemon (`goosed`), which is a local server process that runs on your computer. This server component manages communication between the CLI, extensions, and LLMs. 

Server logs include:
* Server initialization details
* JSON-RPC communication logs
* Server capabilities
* Protocol version information
* Client-server interactions
* Extension loading and initialization
* Tool definitions and schemas
* Extension instructions and capabilities
* Debug-level transport information
* System capabilities and configurations
* Operating system information
* Working directory information
* Transport layer communication details
* Message parsing and handling information
* Request/response cycles
* Error states and handling
* Extension initialization sequences
