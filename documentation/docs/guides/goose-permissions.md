Goose’s permissions determine how much autonomy it has when modifying files, using extensions, and performing automated actions. By selecting a permission mode, you have full control over how Goose interacts with your development environment.

## Permission Modes

| Mode               | Description                                                                                           | Best For                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Completely Autonomous**           | Goose can modify files, use extensions, and delete files **without requiring approval**.              | Users who want **full automation** and seamless integration into their workflow.           |
| **Manual Approval**| Goose **asks for confirmation** before using any tools or extensions.                                 | Users who want to **review and approve** every change and tool usage.                      |
| **Smart Approval** | Goose uses a risk-based approach to **automatically approve low-risk actions** and **flag others** for approval. | Users who want a **balanced mix of autonomy and oversight** based on the action’s impact. |
| **Chat Only**      | Goose **only engages in chat**, with no extension use or file modifications.                          | Users who prefer a **conversational AI experience** for analysis, writing, and reasoning tasks without automation.                    |
       |

:::warning
`Autonomous Mode` is applied by default.

## Configuring Goose Mode

Here's how to configure:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>

    You can change modes before or during a session and it will take effect immediately.

     <Tabs groupId="method">
      <TabItem value="session" label="In Session" default>

      Click the Goose Mode option from the bottom menu. 
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="settings" label="From Settings">
        1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button on the top-left to open the sidebar.
        2. Click the `Settings` button on the sidebar.
        3. Click `Chat`.
        4. Under `Mode`, choose the mode you'd like.

    </Tabs>   
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">

    <Tabs groupId="method">
      <TabItem value="session" label="In Session" default>
        To change modes mid-session, use the `/mode` command.

        * Autonomous: `/mode auto`
        * Smart Approve: `/mode smart_approve`

        └  Set to Auto Mode - full file modification enabled
        ```     
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  :::info
  If you choose `Manual` (in Goose Desktop) or `Approve Mode` (in Goose CLI), you will see "Allow" and "Deny" buttons in your session windows during tool calls. 
  Goose will only ask for permission for tools that it deems are 'write' tools, e.g. any 'text editor write', 'text editor edit', 'bash - rm, cp, mv' commands. 
  
  Read/write approval makes best effort attempt at classifying read or write tools. This is interpreted by your LLM provider.
