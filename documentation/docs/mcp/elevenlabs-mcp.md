This tutorial covers how to add the [ElevenLabs MCP Server](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-mcp) as a Goose extension to enable AI-powered voice generation, voice cloning, audio editing, and speech-to-text transcription.

:::tip TLDR
<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
  [Launch the installer](goose://extension?cmd=uvx&arg=elevenlabs-mcp&id=elevenlabs&name=ElevenLabs&description=ElevenLabs%20voice%20synthesis%20server&env=ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
  **Command**
  ```sh
  uvx elevenlabs-mcp
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  **Environment Variable**
  ```
  ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: <YOUR_API_KEY>

## Configuration

<GooseDesktopInstaller

  extensionName="ElevenLabs"
  description="ElevenLabs voice synthesis server"
  command="uvx"
  args={["elevenlabs-mcp"]}
  envVars={[
    { name: "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY", label: "ElevenLabs API Key" }
  ]}

## Example Usage

In this example, Iâ€™ll show you how to use Goose with the ElevenLabs Extension to create AI-generated voiceovers for a YouTube Short. Goose will take a sample script I provided, generate a narrated version using different AI voices, and seamlessly switch tones mid-script to match the content flow.

By connecting to the ElevenLabs MCP server, Goose can transform plain text into natural-sounding speech, offering multiple voice styles and character options â€” all without any manual recording or editing.

### Goose Prompt

> Hey Goose, create a script for me for my youtube short video, I want there to be two different voices. The first voice should cut me off and be a human narrator style and then switch to a cassual AI tone after I read the prompt. Here's an example of a YT short script I've done in the past: 

Waitâ€¦ Within Seconds, Goose performed Security Audits Across Multiple Projects?! ðŸ”¥

Lets, plug & play to find out how 

Letâ€™s provide Goose with the command it needs to connect to the Filesystem MCP server extensionâ€¦

Now lets play 
propmt:  "Hey Goose, I need to perform a security audit across multiple projects. Let's check forâ€¦ðŸ”¹ Hardcoded Credentials â€“ API keys, passwords, and secrets left in the code.ðŸ”¹ SQL Injection Risks â€“ Unsafe queries that could expose data.ðŸ”¹ Insecure Cryptographic Practices â€“ Weak encryption methods that put data at risk.ANDðŸ”¹ Exposed Config Files â€“ Sensitive information that shouldn't be public.ðŸ”¹ Outdated Dependencies â€“ Security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries."

Go Goose, go Goose!

âœ… Goose scanned the entire codebase across 3 different projects, identified security risks, generated a detailed report with fixes and provided me with step by step instructions on how I can test and verify these code fixes! 

If thatâ€™s not amazing idk what is â€¦
