## Prerequisites

goose includes rust binaries alongside an electron app for the GUI. To work
on the rust backend, you will need to [install rust and cargo][rustup]. To work
on the App, you will also need to [install node and npm][nvm] - we recommend through nvm.

We provide a shortcut to standard commands using [just][just] in our `justfile`.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

For WSL users, you might need to install `build-essential` and `libxcb` otherwise you might run into `cc` linking errors (cc stands for C Compiler).
Install them by running these commands:

```
sudo apt update                   # Refreshes package list (no installs yet)
sudo apt install build-essential  # build-essential is a package that installs all core tools
sudo apt install libxcb1-dev      # libxcb1-dev is the development package for the X C Binding (XCB) library on Linux
```

## Getting Started

### Rust

First let's compile goose and try it out

```
cargo build
```

when that is done, you should now have debug builds of the binaries like the goose cli:

```
./target/debug/goose --help
```

If you haven't used the CLI before, you can use this compiled version to do first time configuration:

```
./target/debug/goose configure
```

And then once you have a connection to an LLM provider working, you can run a session!

```
./target/debug/goose session
```

These same commands can be recompiled and immediately run using `cargo run -p goose-cli` for iteration.
As you make changes to the rust code, you can try it out on the CLI, or also run checks, tests, and linter:

```
cargo check  # do your changes compile
cargo test  # do the tests pass with your changes
cargo fmt   # format your code
./scripts/clippy-lint.sh # run the linter
```

### Node

Now let's make sure you can run the app.

```
just run-ui
```

The start gui will both build a release build of rust (as if you had done `cargo build -r`) and start the electron process.
You should see the app open a window, and drop you into first time setup. When you've gone through the setup,
you can talk to goose!

You can now make changes in the code in ui/desktop to iterate on the GUI half of goose.

### Regenerating the OpenAPI schema

The file `ui/desktop/openapi.json` is automatically generated during the build.
It is written by the `generate_schema` binary in `crates/goose-server`.
If you need to update the spec without starting the UI, run:

```
just generate-openapi
```

This command regenerates `ui/desktop/openapi.json` and then runs the UI's
`generate-api` script to rebuild the TypeScript client from that spec.

Changes to the API should be made in the Rust source under `crates/goose-server/src/`.

### Debugging

To debug the Goose server, you can run it from your preferred IDE. How to configure the command
to start the server will depend on your IDE. The command to run is:

```
export GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY=test
cargo run --package goose-server --bin goosed -- agent   # or: `just run-server`
```

The server will start listening on port `3000` by default, but this can be changed by setting the
`GOOSE_PORT` environment variable.

Once the server is running, you can start a UI and connect it to the server by running:

```
just debug-ui
```

The UI will now be connected to the server you started in your IDE, allowing you to set breakpoints
and step through the server code as you interact with the UI.

## Creating a fork

To fork the repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/block/goose and click “Fork” (top-right corner).
2. This creates https://github.com/<your-username>/goose under your GitHub account.
3. Clone your fork (not the main repo):

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/goose.git
cd goose
```

4. Add the main repository as upstream:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/block/goose.git
```

5. Create a branch in your fork for your changes:

```
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

6. Sync your fork with the main repo:

```
git fetch upstream

# Merge them into your local branch (e.g., 'main' or 'my-feature-branch')
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

7. Push to your fork. Because you’re the owner of the fork, you have permission to push here.

```
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

8. Open a Pull Request from your branch on your fork to block/goose’s main branch.

## Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date

To ensure a smooth integration of your contributions, it's important that your fork is kept up-to-date with the main repository. This helps avoid conflicts and allows us to merge your pull requests more quickly. Here’s how you can sync your fork:

### Syncing Your Fork with the Main Repository

1. **Add the Main Repository as a Remote** (Skip if you have already set this up):

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/block/goose.git
   ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes from the Main Repository**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Checkout Your Development Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Merge Changes from the Main Branch into Your Branch**:

   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   Resolve any conflicts that arise and commit the changes.

5. **Push the Merged Changes to Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

This process will help you keep your branch aligned with the ongoing changes in the main repository, minimizing integration issues when it comes time to merge!

### Before Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit a pull request, please ensure your fork is synchronized as described above. This check ensures your changes are compatible with the latest in the main repository and streamlines the review process.

If you encounter any issues during this process or have any questions, please reach out by opening an issue [here][issues], and we'll be happy to help.

## Env Vars

You may want to make more frequent changes to your provider setup or similar to test things out
as a developer. You can use environment variables to change things on the fly without redoing
your configuration.

> [!TIP]
> At the moment, we are still updating some of the CLI configuration to make sure this is
> respected.

You can change the provider goose points to via the `GOOSE_PROVIDER` env var. If you already
have a credential for that provider in your keychain from previously setting up, it should
reuse it. For things like automations or to test without doing official setup, you can also
set the relevant env vars for that provider. For example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
or `DATABRICKS_HOST`. Refer to the provider details for more info on required keys.

## Enable traces in goose with [locally hosted Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host)

- Start a local Langfuse using the docs [here](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/docker-compose). Create an organization and project and create API credentials.
- Set the environment variables so that goose can connect to the langfuse server:

```
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=publickey-local
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY=secretkey-local
```

Then you can view your traces at http://localhost:3000
